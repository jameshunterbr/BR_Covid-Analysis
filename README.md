# BR_Covid-Analysis

This is the analysis of the Ministry of Sa√∫de's files for COVID spread in Brazil. There are some anomalies in this data that I will be exploring. Everyone is invited to help me in this exploration as the presentation of the data by the Ministry is at best confused.

This is also the home for presentations to the WebHall Conference of Escola Paulista de Medicina in August 2020 and to the Hope Lab of Northwestern Medical School in September 2020.
